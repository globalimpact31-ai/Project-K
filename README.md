Zoner Games is a lightweight, immersive arcade website built entirely in a single HTML file. It features a modern, neon-aesthetic interface with procedural graphics—meaning all visual effects, particles, and animations are generated by code rather than external image files.
The portal divides gaming into three specific "Zones":
Reflex Zone (Action): High-speed target practice.
Mind Zone (Puzzle): Cognitive memory challenges.
Zen Zone (Relaxation): Interactive generative art.
🎮 The Games
⚡ Reflex Zone: Neon Aim
Test your reaction time and precision.
Objective: Click the neon targets before they shrink and vanish.
Mechanics: Targets spawn at increasing speeds. Missed targets end the game.
Tech: HTML5 Canvas for high-performance rendering.
🧠 Mind Zone: Cosmic Memory
A test of focus and short-term memory.
Objective: Find matching pairs of cosmic symbols within the grid.
Mechanics: Flip cards to reveal icons. Match all pairs in the fewest moves possible.
Tech: DOM manipulation and CSS 3D transforms.
🌿 Zen Zone: Flow Garden
A non-competitive space for relaxation.
Objective: Create light.
Mechanics: Move your mouse or touch the screen to generate flowing particle trails. No score, no "Game Over."
Tech: Particle physics simulation via HTML5 Canvas.
